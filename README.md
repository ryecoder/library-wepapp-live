# Library Webapp Live

A simple library list app where you can add list of books. Books can be tagged as read, unread, liked, and it also accepts rating and some comments regards the book. Perfect for book lovers who wanted to track their book reads and also learnings about them. Every data is saved on your local browser's storage for long term access. You can personalize this app by changing the profile picture. Simply click the text below it or the image itself to upload new profile url link.

I use Visual Studio code for coding and running a live server with hot reload. But you can run the index.html file on your browser and manually reload the browser if it is more preferred. To run in Visual Studio code.
